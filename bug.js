This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a remote image URL that is incorrectly formatted or points to a non-existent resource.  The image fails to load, and no error is thrown in the console, making debugging difficult.  The component simply remains blank or displays a broken image icon, offering no clues to the underlying problem. This is particularly problematic when dealing with dynamic image URLs, where the cause is not immediately apparent.
